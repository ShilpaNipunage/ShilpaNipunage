## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🏫 [Multi-Agent School Beacon](https://github.com/ShilpaNipunage/AI_POC/tree/main/n8nWorkflows/Beacon-Summary)
LLM + n8n pipeline to extract weekly academic updates from school newsletters and notify students/parents via Gmail and Google Tasks.

### 📈 [OTEL Log Intelligence Graph](https://github.com/ShilpaNipunage/AI_POC/tree/main/OTEL_log_analyzer)
Transform OpenTelemetry logs into a Neo4j knowledge graph, and use LangGraph agent to answer queries like “Which services communicate?”

### ☁️ [LangGraph Agent with MCP & A2A Integration](https://github.com/ShilpaNipunage/AI_POC/tree/main/langchain_MCP_A2A)
Containerized multi-agent system using LangGraph, GPT-4o-mini, and Google A2A, with MCP tool serving and Envoy sidecars for resilient, observable agent communication.
